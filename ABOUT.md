## Project Overview

The **Multi-Tenant WorkSafeMaps Platform** is an integrated system to enable multiple organizations (tenants) to manage safety, operations, and worksite activities through a map-based interface. Key functionalities include:

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Supporting isolated scopes per organization.
- **Worksite and Incident Management**: Define geographic worksites, manage incident reporting, and track related assets and activities.
- **Team & User Management**: Role-based access across teams and tenants for effective collaboration.
- **Alerts and Projects**: Create and manage alerts on specific events and track projects across worksites.
- **Interactive Mapping**: A feature-rich map component displaying layered data with real-time updates.

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
  - Data isolation across organizations.
  - Users can belong to multiple tenants with different roles.

- **Worksite Management**
  - Define worksites with geospatial data (points and boundaries).
  - Associate teams and safety protocols with worksites.

- **Incident Reporting**
  - Authenticated users can report and manage incidents.
  - Incident details include location, description, type, timestamp, and possible asset associations.

- **Team & User Management**
  - Invite and assign users to tenants or teams.
  - Role-based access control at both tenant and team levels.

- **Asset, POI, Alerts & Project Management**
  - Track assets with location and status information.
  - Define points of interest that include hazards or safety equipment.
  - Configure and trigger alerts based on incident reports or geofence breaches.
  - Create projects linked to worksites, assign teams, and monitor statuses.

- **Real-Time Updates**
  - Automatic updates of incident reports and asset details using Convex’s real-time features.

- **Interactive Map Display**
  - Map interface (using React Leaflet or similar) with integrated data layers to control the display of worksites, incidents, teams, assets, and POIs.

---

## Application Architecture

The system is structured into two main segments:

1. **Convex Backend**:  
   - Holds a comprehensive multi-tenant schema.
   - Implements queries and mutations (separated into function files like tenants.ts, worksites.ts, incidents.ts, etc.).
   - Enforces role-based access control (RBAC) and tenant-based data isolation.

2. **Next.js Frontend**:  
   - Integrates Convex using hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`).
   - Manages tenant context and UI components (worksites, incidents, teams, assets, alerts, projects, etc.).
   - Renders an interactive map enriched with real-time data updates.

Below is a simplified Mermaid diagram illustrating the high-level architecture:

## Backend Implementation (Convex)

### Schema (schema.ts)

The Convex schema defines the following collections:

- **tenants**  
  Stores tenant organization details.

- **userTenantMemberships**  
  Links users to tenants along with their roles.

- **worksites**  
  Stores geographic and descriptive information about worksites (linked to tenantId).

- **teams**  
  Manages team details for each tenant.

- **teamMemberships**  
  Maps users to teams, including in-team roles and related worksite assignments.

- **incidents**  
  Tracks incident reports including geolocation, description, type, and associated users/assets.

- **assets**  
  Contains data on equipment or vehicles with location, type and status.

- **pois**  
  Records points of interest such as hazards or safety equipment markers.

- **alerts**  
  Manages alert rules and triggers linked to incidents or asset-related changes.

- **projects**  
  Maintains project-related information optionally connected to worksites.

*Indexes and relation considerations:*  
Key indexes (especially on tenantId) are defined for faster queries. Data integrity, including conceptual foreign key relationships, is enforced through access control in the Convex functions.

### RBAC and Tenant Isolation

- **User Context:** All Convex functions obtain the authenticated user's identity via `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`.
- **Permissions:** Every function first checks that the user is a member of the tenant and verifies the role (from `userTenantMemberships` or `teamMemberships`).
- **Isolation:** Queries and mutations never return data outside of the user's permitted tenant context.

### Queries & Mutations

Functions are organized into multiple files, each handling relevant domain logic:

- **tenants.ts:**  
  - `getMyTenants`  
  - `createTenant` (with access restrictions)  
  - `inviteUserToTenant`

- **worksites.ts:**  
  - `getWorksites`  
  - `createWorksite`  
  - `updateWorksite`

- **incidents.ts:**  
  - `getIncidentsForWorksite`  
  - `addIncident`

- **users.ts / teamManagement.ts:**  
  - `getTeamMembers`  
  - `addUserToTeam`  
  - `updateUserRole`

- **assets.ts:**  
  - `getAssets`  
  - `updateAssetStatus`

- **pois.ts, alerts.ts, projects.ts:**  
  - Similar tenant-scoped functions to manage respective data.

Each function enforces tenant-based access ensuring strict isolation and proper RBAC.

## Frontend Integration (Next.js & React)

### Tenant Context Switching

- **UI Mechanism:**  
  Users belonging to multiple tenants can select an active tenant context.
- **Context Updates:**  
  Once set, all data fetching, mutations, and UI components will reference the currently selected tenant.
- **Implementation:**  
  Use Next.js client components with context hooks (e.g., `useLoggedInUser` from `lib/BackendContext`) to drive tenant-specific logic.

### Map Component and Real-time Updates

- **Interactive Map:**  
  Utilizes react-leaflet (or a similar tool) to display data layers:
  - Worksites
  - Incidents
  - Assets
  - POIs
- **Real-Time Sync:**  
  Uses Convex's real-time capabilities to update data instantly across the platform.
- **Layer Management:**  
  The map component dynamically reads the tenant context and permissions, ensuring that only authorized data is displayed.

---

## Integration Flow

1. **Authentication:**  
   User signs in using the pre-configured Convex Auth system.

2. **Tenant Selection:**  
   Once logged in, the user selects their active tenant context. This choice governs all subsequent queries and mutations.

3. **Data Interaction:**  
   - The frontend uses hooks (e.g., `useQuery` & `useMutation`) to fetch or modify data.
   - Data is fetched from Convex based on tenant membership and user roles.
   - User actions (e.g., creating a worksite, reporting an incident) invoke Convex functions with RBAC checks.

4. **Real-Time Updates:**  
   Whenever data is updated (like an incident report or asset status change), all connected clients within the tenant receive updates in real-time.

5. **Map Display:**  
   The interactive map displays current data layers and supports additional user interactions like geofencing and layer toggling.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/worksafemaps-platform.git
   cd worksafemaps-platform
   ```

2. **Setup Convex Backend:**
   - Install dependencies.
   - Define your Convex deployment settings.
   - Update the `convex/schema.ts` as needed.
   - Deploy the Convex functions.

3. **Setup Frontend:**
   - Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`.
   - Configure environment settings for Convex in Next.js.
   - Run the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

4. **Authentication:**
   - Leverage the pre-configured Convex Auth system to sign in.
   - Ensure that the authentication flow integrates with your tenant context switching mechanism.

5. **Usage:**
   - Once logged in and tenant is selected, navigate through the UI components to manage worksites, incidents, alerts, assets, teams, etc.
   - Interact with the map to view real-time data layers.

## Notes

- **RBAC Enforcement:**  
  All Convex functions thoroughly verify user permissions to safeguard multi-tenant data integrity.
  
- **Progressive Enhancement:**  
  Prioritize core functionalities like multi-tenancy, worksite management, and incident reporting. Additional features (assets, projects, advanced alert configurations) can be integrated progressively.

- **Removal of Placeholder Data:**  
  Ensure that no mock data or temporary state management remain; the application should rely entirely on Convex for state persistence.

- **Team Collaboration:**  
  Frontend components are designed as modular Next.js client components for ease of collaboration and future scalability.
