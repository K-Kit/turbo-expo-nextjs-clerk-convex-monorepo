        No trip to Paris is complete without a visit to the Eiffel Tower.
        Standing beneath its towering structure, the city unfolded before me
        like a masterpiece. The Louvre, with its grandeur and cultural
        treasures, offered a journey through art and history, leaving me
        awe-inspired.

        each bite felt like a celebration of culinary artistry.
