  - Incidents list
  - User profile

### Convex Integration

## Next Steps: Phase 2 - Map Integration üó∫Ô∏è

The next phase will focus on integrating mapping functionality:

1. **Map SDK Integration**
   - Add MapLibre or Mapbox dependency
   - Implement base map view component

2. **Map Layers**
   - Create layer system for worksites, incidents, assets, POIs
   - Implement markers and popups for map items

3. **Location Services**

This phase will transform the placeholder map screen into a fully functional interactive map that serves as the core navigation tool for the application.
