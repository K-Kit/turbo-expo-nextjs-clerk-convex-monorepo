Based on the ABOUT.md and the provided codebase, here's a plan for what's next:

## Implementation Status Assessment

1. **Backend (Convex)**
   - Schema and data models are established (schema.ts)
   - Core functionality exists for users, tenants, worksites, incidents, and geofences
   - OpenAI integration started

2. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   - Basic app structure with authentication (sign-in, sign-up)
   - Main page and notes section
   - Incidents page being developed

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Map Integration**
   - Implement the interactive map component using react-leaflet
   - Add layer controls for worksites, incidents, assets
   - Enable real-time updates on the map

2. **Enhance Incident Management**
   - Finish the incident detail page
   - Add incident creation/editing functionality
   - Implement incident filtering and search

3. **Develop Team & User Management**
   - Build team creation/editing UI
   - Implement team membership management
   - Create role-based permission controls in the UI

4. **Add Asset & POI Tracking**
   - Create backend functions for assets and POIs
   - Develop UI for managing these entities
   - Integrate with the map display

5. **Implement Alerts System**
   - Build alert rules configuration
   - Create notification mechanism
   - Set up geofence-triggered alerts

6. **Create Project Management Module**
   - Design project data structures
   - Build project assignment and tracking UI
   - Link projects to worksites and teams

7. **Tenant Switching Mechanism**
   - Implement UI for users to switch between tenants
   - Ensure proper context isolation

8. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Add comprehensive tests for backend functions
   - Document API endpoints and component usage
   - Create user documentation

## Immediate Action Items

1. Focus on the map component implementation
2. Complete the incidents page you're currently working on
3. Set up proper tenant context isolation in the frontend
4. Implement basic asset tracking functionality
